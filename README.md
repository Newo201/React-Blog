# Full Stack Blog Website

The purpose of this website is to create, read, update and delete blog posts relating to various topics. This involved creating a React Frontend to display the blog material and a Node/Express backend connected to a Postgres database to store the blog posts.

## Ideas For Improvement

- Allow users to upload images to the blog post
- Have a fully integrated editing functionality on the blog posts (like a normal blog website)
